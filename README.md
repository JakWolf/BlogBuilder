# Overview
When generating the blog, all files get read from the `in` folder and all generated files get written to the `out` folder. 

There are 3 folder inside the `in` folder you have to know about: `blog_posts`, `templates`, `root`, `resources`.

Every file in the `root` and `blog_posts` folder gets read and rendered out with 
the head, header and footer applied. Those template files get read from the `template` folder. 
In addition you can wrap blog posts with something like a div in
in `blog_start.html` and `blog_end.html`.

The `resources` folder and the `style.css` just get copied in the root of the `out` folder.

# Vars
You can define variables in the var.txt file where they get parsed line by line. 
You can use variables in any file in the `root` `blog_posts` or `template` folder.

# Blog posts
In the blog posts files (insied the `blog_posts` folder), on top of every file, you have to write a comment with two variables:
```
<!--
%%BLOG_POST_NAME=My blog title
%%BLOG_POST_DATE=11/06/2024
-->
```
You can use them inside the `blog_posts` file and also inside the `blog_star.html` and `blog_end.html` template files.
They also get used for generating links in the blog post list. The format for the date is DD/MM/YYYY.

Two variables get created automatically: `%%BLOG_POST_LIST` and `%%BLOG_POST_ALL`.

`BLOG_POSTS_LIST` is a html list with all blog post links. They are ordered by date with the newest on top.

`%%BLOG_POSTS_ALL` is a string with all blog posts concatenate if you just want to have them listed on one page.
